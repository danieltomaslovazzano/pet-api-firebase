# PR Review Checklist - Legacy E2E Cleanup

## üîç Review Guidelines

### **Quick Review Points** ‚ö°
- [ ] **New system works**: Run `npm run test:e2e-new` to verify
- [ ] **No critical files lost**: Check that only legacy/duplicate files removed
- [ ] **Documentation complete**: Review cleanup report and migration guide
- [ ] **Breaking changes understood**: Team acknowledges command changes

### **Detailed Review** üìã

#### **Files Removed (Major Categories)**
- [ ] `tests/e2e/` directory (legacy system) - **SAFE TO DELETE**
- [ ] `scripts/run-e2e-dev.js` and 6 other legacy scripts - **SAFE TO DELETE**  
- [ ] 2,000+ legacy report files - **SAFE TO DELETE**
- [ ] 10 legacy npm scripts in package.json - **SAFE TO DELETE**

#### **Files Preserved (Critical)**
- [ ] `tests/e2e-new/` system - **KEPT AND WORKING**
- [ ] All business logic controllers - **UNTOUCHED**
- [ ] All production code - **UNTOUCHED**
- [ ] Database and API code - **UNTOUCHED**

#### **Configuration Changes**
- [ ] `package.json` scripts updated correctly
- [ ] `test:e2e` now points to new system
- [ ] Legacy commands removed (expected breaking change)

#### **Safety Measures**
- [ ] Backup branch exists: `backup/legacy-e2e-tests`
- [ ] New system tested and working
- [ ] Documentation for rollback available

### **Breaking Changes Impact** ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### **Commands That Changed**
```bash
# STILL WORKS (no breaking change)
npm run test:e2e  # Now uses new system

# REMOVED (breaking changes)
npm run test:e2e:auth        # Remove - use unified system
npm run test:e2e:users       # Remove - use unified system  
npm run test:e2e:orgs        # Remove - use unified system
npm run test:e2e:pets        # Remove - use unified system
# + 6 more legacy commands
```

#### **Migration Path for Team**
```bash
# Old way (NO LONGER WORKS)
npm run test:e2e:auth

# New way (WORKS)
npm run test:e2e              # Runs all 66 tests
npm run test:e2e-new:report   # Generate HTML reports
```

### **Risk Assessment** üõ°Ô∏è

#### **Low Risk** ‚úÖ
- All legacy files are duplicates/obsolete
- New system already proven working (100% success rate)
- Business logic completely untouched
- Full rollback possible

#### **Medium Risk** ‚ö†Ô∏è  
- Team needs to learn new commands
- Historical reports archived (not lost, just moved)
- Breaking changes require team communication

#### **High Risk** ‚ùå
- **NONE IDENTIFIED** - This is a pure cleanup operation

### **Approval Criteria** üìù

#### **Required Approvals**
- [ ] **Technical Lead**: Breaking changes acknowledged
- [ ] **Developer Team**: Migration path understood  
- [ ] **QA Team**: New testing process approved

#### **Pre-Merge Checklist**
- [ ] New system runs successfully
- [ ] Documentation reviewed
- [ ] Team migration communicated
- [ ] CI/CD integration planned
