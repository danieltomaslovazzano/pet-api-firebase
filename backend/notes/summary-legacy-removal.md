# Legacy Firestore Code & Test Removal Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the removal of all Firestore (database) dependent code and tests following the migration to PostgreSQL/Prisma. Firebase Auth and Firebase Storage logic have been preserved and refactored as needed.

---

## What Was Removed
- All Firestore (database) logic from controllers, services, and scripts.
- All test files that depended on Firestore, including:
  - `tests/users/users.test.js`
  - `tests/membership/membership.test.js`
  - `tests/organization/organization.test.js`
  - `tests/permissions/organization.test.js`
  - `tests/performance/database-performance.test.js`
  - `tests/unit/authorization.test.js`
- Firestore-related helpers and mocks.

## What Was Kept
- All Firebase Auth (authentication) logic.
- All Firebase Storage (file upload) logic.
- All Prisma/Postgres-based models and tests.
- All tests that use only Prisma/Postgres or Firebase Auth/Storage.

## Next Steps for Testing
- Rebuild the test suite incrementally, focusing on:
  - Core business logic
  - API endpoints
  - Integration with Prisma/Postgres and Firebase Auth/Storage
- Use modern testing practices and utilities for Prisma and Firebase Auth/Storage.
- Update documentation and test plans as new tests are added.

## Rationale
- The removed code and tests were tightly coupled to Firestore and could not be adapted to the new stack.
- This cleanup reduces technical debt, clarifies the codebase, and enables a more maintainable and reliable test suite moving forward.
