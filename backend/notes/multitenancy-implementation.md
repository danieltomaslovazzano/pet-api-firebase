# Multitenancy Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of multitenancy in the Pet API backend. The project has been migrated from Firestore to PostgreSQL/Prisma, and multitenancy support has been added to ensure data isolation and proper access control between organizations.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. **Shared Schema Approach**
- **Decision:** We chose a shared schema approach where all tenants (organizations) share the same database and tables.
- **Implementation:** An `organizationId` field was added to tenant-scoped tables such as `Pet`, `Conversation`, `Message`, etc.
- **Advantage:** Simpler setup compared to separate schemas per tenant, easier maintenance, and more cost-effective.

### 2. **Organization Context Middleware**
- **Implementation:** Created `organizationContext.js` middleware that:
  - Extracts the organization ID from the `X-Organization-Id` HTTP header
  - Validates that the user is a member of the organization (unless super admin)
  - Attaches the organization ID to the request object (`req.organizationId`)

### 3. **Permission Model**
- **Roles:**
  - Added `isSuperAdmin` flag to the `User` model for system-wide administration
  - Organization-specific roles managed through the `Membership` model (admin, manager, moderator, etc.)
- **Access Control:**
  - Super admins can access any data across organizations
  - Organization admins can manage their organization's data
  - Regular users can only access data within their organization

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Schema Changes**
- Added `organizationId` to the following models:
  - `Pet`
  - `Conversation`
  - `Message`
- Added `isSuperAdmin` boolean flag to `User` model
- Updated relationships with appropriate references

### 2. **Controller Refactoring**
All controllers have been updated to support multitenancy:

#### Admin Controller
- Added organization context filtering for all admin queries
- Super admins can see data across organizations
- Organization admins can only see data within their organization

#### Pet Controller
- All pet queries now filter by `organizationId` unless user is super admin
- Creation operations set the organization context from request
- Update/delete operations verify organization membership

#### Organization Controller
- Super admins can access any organization
- Users can only view/manage organizations they are members of
- Organization memberships respect tenant boundaries

#### User Controller
- Added organization context checks for user operations
- Modified user creation to handle organization context
- Added proper validation for cross-organization access

#### Conversation & Message Controllers
- Added organization context to all conversations and messages
- Ensured conversations are only accessible to members of the same organization
- Messages inherit organization context from their conversation

#### Membership Controller
- Enforced organization boundaries when querying memberships
- Added proper validation for cross-organization membership management

## What's Left To Do

1. **Update Client Applications**
   - Add support for sending the `X-Organization-Id` header
   - Update UI to show organization switching capability

2. **Data Migration**
   - Existing data needs organization IDs assigned
   - Create migration scripts to update records with proper organization context

3. **Testing**
   - Comprehensive testing of multitenancy boundary enforcement
   - Create tests that verify proper data isolation
   - Test super admin capabilities across organizations

4. **Documentation**
   - Update API documentation to include organization context requirements
   - Document the header-based approach for developers

5. **Model Adapters**
   - Update model adapter code to match the controllers' multitenancy enforcement
   - Ensure all database queries include organization filtering

## Usage Guidelines

### For API Consumers

1. Set the `X-Organization-Id` header on all requests to specify the organization context.
2. If no header is provided, the API will operate in a non-organizational context (limited functionality).
3. Users can only access data for organizations they are members of.
4. Super admins can access data across organizations.

### For Developers

1. Always use `req.organizationId` to filter queries by organization.
2. For non-super-admin users, always validate that they are members of the organization.
3. For operations that modify data, ensure the user has appropriate permissions within the organization.
4. When creating new records, always set the `organizationId` from the request context.

## Conclusion

The multitenancy implementation provides data isolation between organizations while maintaining flexibility through the shared schema approach. The system allows for users to belong to multiple organizations, with proper access control based on their role within each organization. Super admin users maintain the ability to manage the entire system across organization boundaries.
