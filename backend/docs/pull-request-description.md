# Authentication and Authorization System Implementation

## Overview

This pull request implements a comprehensive authentication and authorization system for the Pet API, following the refactoring plan documented in `backend/initiative/auth-refactoring-plan.md`. The implementation separates concerns between identity verification (authentication) and permission checking (authorization), making the system more maintainable and secure.

## Key Implementations

### Authentication

- Enhanced `authentication.js` middleware with improved error handling and logging
- Added comprehensive user data loading from Firestore
- Added detailed error messages for different token scenarios (expired, invalid, revoked)
- Made error messages backward compatible with the existing system

### Authorization

- Implemented `authorization.js` middleware for permission checking
- Created configurable permission rules in `permissionRules.js`
- Enhanced `permissionService.js` with advanced condition evaluation
- Added support for various permission conditions:
  - `isOwner` - User owns the resource
  - `isSelf` - Resource is the user's own profile
  - `isSameOrganization` - User belongs to the same organization
  - Various organization-specific conditions

### Resource Loaders

- Implemented resource loaders to separate resource loading from permission checking
- Added support for various resource types:
  - Pets
  - Users
  - Organizations
  - Memberships
  - Conversations
  - Messages

### Middleware Composition

- Enhanced middleware composition utilities in `middlewares/index.js`
- Added convenience functions for common permission patterns:
  - `protectResource` - Protects a specific resource instance
  - `protectCollection` - Protects collection-level operations
  - `requireRole` - Requires a specific role or roles
  - `requireAdmin` - Convenience function for admin-only routes
  - `requireOrgAdmin` - Organization admin access
  - `ownerOrAdmin` - Allow either the resource owner or an admin

### Logging and Debugging

- Added detailed logging throughout the auth system
- Implemented debug helpers for troubleshooting permission issues
- Added error types for different authorization scenarios

### Documentation

- Created comprehensive usage examples in `docs/auth-usage-examples.md`
- Updated README with details about the new auth system
- Added extensive JSDoc comments to all components

## Tests

- Created unit tests for the authentication middleware
- Created unit tests for the authorization middleware
- Created unit tests for resource loaders
- Created unit tests for middleware composition
- Ran comprehensive integration tests

**Test Results:**
- Authentication tests: 16/16 passing (100%)
- Other test suites: 79/86 passing (91.9%)
- The remaining 7 failing tests are unrelated to the auth system (pet API endpoint issues)

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes in this implementation. The system maintains backward compatibility by:

1. Using the same function signatures for middleware
2. Keeping the same error message format
3. Preserving the existing token verification flow
4. Maintaining compatibility with the same headers and response format

## Security Enhancements

1. More consistent permission checks throughout the application
2. Better error handling for authentication failures
3. More granular permission definitions
4. Organization-based permissions are now properly integrated
