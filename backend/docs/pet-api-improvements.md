# Pet API Improvements

## Overview

This document summarizes the improvements made to the Pet API to address security and functional issues identified during testing.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Unauthorized users could update pets (fixed)
   - Unauthorized users could delete pets (fixed)
   - Missing proper authorization checks on resource operations (fixed)

2. **Missing Functionality**
   - Search endpoint was not implemented (fixed)
   - Filtering by species was not working correctly (fixed)
   - Sorting by name parameter was not working (fixed)

3. **Other Improvements**
   - Better error handling and validation
   - Enhanced search capabilities with partial matching
   - Improved filtering with case-insensitive matching
   - Client-side sorting and filtering implementation to avoid Firestore index requirements

## Implementation Details

### 1. Route Protection

The pet routes now use proper authorization middleware:

```javascript
// Fix: Use ownerOrAdmin middleware for resource permission
router.put('/:id', 
  validatePetId, 
  ownerOrAdmin('pets'),
  validateUpdatePet,
  petController.updatePet
);

// Fix: Use ownerOrAdmin middleware for resource permission
router.delete('/:id', 
  validatePetId, 
  ownerOrAdmin('pets'),
  petController.deletePet
);
```

### 2. Search Implementation

Added a new search endpoint with validation:

```javascript
// Search endpoint - must come before /:id to avoid conflict
router.get('/search', validateSearchQuery, petController.searchPets);
```

With controller implementation:

```javascript
exports.searchPets = (req, res) => {
    // Extract search parameters
    const { 
        name, species, status, breed,
        page = 1, 
        limit = 10, 
        sort = 'name' 
    } = req.query;
    
    // Build search criteria object
    const searchCriteria = {};
    if (name) searchCriteria.name = name;
    if (species) searchCriteria.species = species;
    if (status) searchCriteria.status = status;
    if (breed) searchCriteria.breed = breed;
    
    // Call the model with search criteria
    petModel.searchPets(searchCriteria, pageNumber, pageSize, sort, (err, pets) => {
        // ...
    });
};
```

### 3. Filtering & Sorting

Implemented client-side filtering to avoid Firestore index requirements:

```javascript
// Apply filters in memory
if (filters) {
  if (filters.species) {
    // Case-insensitive filtering for species
    pets = pets.filter(pet => 
      pet.species && pet.species.toLowerCase() === filters.species.toLowerCase()
    );
  }
  // ...
}
```

## Testing Changes

- Updated test expectations to match new API behavior
- Tests now correctly validate the search endpoint functionality
- Tests properly handle both success and error conditions

## Future Improvements

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Replace client-side filtering with proper Firestore queries and indexes for production
   - Implement cursor-based pagination for better performance with large datasets

2. **Search Enhancement**
   - Add full-text search capabilities using Algolia, Elasticsearch, or Firebase Extensions
   - Support more complex search operations (fuzzy matching, geo-search, etc.)

3. **Validation**
   - Enhance validation for edge cases and additional fields
   - Add more detailed error messages for better client feedback

## Conclusion

These improvements have significantly enhanced the security and functionality of the Pet API. The authorization system now properly protects resources, and the search/filtering capabilities provide a better user experience.
