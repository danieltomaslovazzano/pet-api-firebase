# PostgreSQL Migration Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our comprehensive testing strategy for validating the migration from Firebase to PostgreSQL. The testing phase is critical to ensure that our application continues to function correctly with both database systems and that the adapter pattern allows for seamless switching between them.

## Test Objectives

1. Verify data integrity between Firebase and PostgreSQL implementations
2. Validate all API endpoints work correctly with PostgreSQL
3. Ensure the adapter pattern correctly routes database operations
4. Measure performance differences between Firebase and PostgreSQL
5. Verify security and authorization mechanisms work with the new implementation

## Test Environment Setup

### Local Development Environment
- PostgreSQL database running locally or in Docker
- Environment variables configured for testing
- Test database with isolated data

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated test runs for both database implementations
- Configuration to switch between Firebase and PostgreSQL

## Types of Tests

### 1. Unit Tests

| Category | Description | Priority |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Model Methods | Test individual model functions | High |
| Data Validation | Test validation logic in models | High |
| Error Handling | Test error conditions and responses | Medium |
| Edge Cases | Test boundary conditions | Medium |

### 2. Integration Tests

| Category | Description | Priority |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| API Endpoints | Test API endpoints with both database implementations | High |
| Authentication | Test authentication flows with Firebase Auth and PostgreSQL | High |
| Complex Operations | Test operations involving multiple models | Medium |

### 3. Database Switching Tests

| Category | Description | Priority |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Config Switching | Test switching between databases via environment variables | High |
| Data Consistency | Verify operations work consistently on both implementations | High |

### 4. Performance Tests

| Category | Description | Priority |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Query Performance | Benchmark query operations on both databases | Medium |
| Load Testing | Test system under load conditions | Medium |

## Test Implementation Schedule

### Week 1: Setup and Unit Tests

#### Day 1-2: Test Infrastructure Setup
- Configure Jest for testing both database implementations
- Set up test database and fixtures
- Create test helpers and utilities

#### Day 3-5: Model Unit Tests
- Implement unit tests for User model
- Implement unit tests for Pet model
- Implement unit tests for Organization model
- Implement unit tests for Membership model
- Implement unit tests for Conversation and Message models

### Week 2: Integration and Switching Tests

#### Day 1-3: API Integration Tests
- Implement tests for User API endpoints
- Implement tests for Pet API endpoints
- Implement tests for Organization and Membership endpoints
- Implement tests for Conversation and Message endpoints

#### Day 4-5: Database Switching Tests
- Test runtime switching between databases
- Test data consistency across implementations

### Week 3: Performance Testing and Bugfixing

#### Day 1-3: Performance Testing
- Benchmark critical database operations
- Compare Firebase vs PostgreSQL performance
- Identify optimization opportunities

#### Day 4-5: Bug Fixing and Refinements
- Address issues found during testing
- Refine adapter implementation as needed
- Document test results and findings

## Test Data Management

### Fixtures
- Create fixtures for all models
- Generate test data that covers various scenarios
- Implement data cleanup between test runs

### Test Database
- Use a dedicated test database for PostgreSQL tests
- Implement transaction rollback for test isolation
- Use Firebase emulator for Firebase tests

## Reporting and Documentation

- Document test coverage for each model and endpoint
- Report performance comparisons between Firebase and PostgreSQL
- Track and document any bugs or issues found during testing

## Success Criteria

Testing will be considered successful when:

1. All unit tests pass with both Firebase and PostgreSQL implementations
2. All API endpoints function correctly with PostgreSQL
3. Database switching works correctly via configuration
4. PostgreSQL performance meets or exceeds Firebase performance for critical operations
5. No critical bugs are found, or all identified bugs are resolved

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues:

1. Document the specific failure points
2. Implement necessary fixes
3. If issues cannot be resolved, maintain the ability to fall back to Firebase implementation via the adapter pattern
