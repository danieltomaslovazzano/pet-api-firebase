## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Message Update Tests**
   ```javascript
   // Fix testMessage undefined issue in message-management.e2e.js
   // Ensure proper test data setup in beforeEach
   ```

2. **Update i18n Reporter**
   ```javascript
   // Add missing syncWithJestResults method to Enhanced Reporter
   // Or remove the call if not needed
   ```

### Medium-term Improvements
