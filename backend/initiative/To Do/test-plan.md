# PostgreSQL Migration: Phase 5 Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for validating the PostgreSQL migration. The testing phase is crucial to ensure that the application functions correctly with both Firebase and PostgreSQL databases, and that the adapter pattern allows seamless switching between them.

## Test Objectives

1. Verify data integrity between Firebase and PostgreSQL implementations
2. Validate all API endpoints work with PostgreSQL database
3. Ensure the adapter pattern correctly routes requests based on configuration
4. Measure performance differences between the two database systems
5. Verify security and authorization mechanisms work with the new implementation

## Test Environments

We will use three environments for comprehensive testing:

1. **Development Environment**: Local testing with PostgreSQL
2. **Hybrid Environment**: Testing with the ability to switch between Firebase and PostgreSQL
3. **Staging Environment**: Pre-production environment that mirrors production

## Test Types

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests will verify that individual model methods work correctly with PostgreSQL.

| Test Category | Description | Priority |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| CRUD Operations | Test Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for each model | High |
| Data Validation | Test validation logic, required fields, etc. | High |
| Error Handling | Test error paths, validation failures, etc. | Medium |
| Edge Cases | Test boundary conditions and special cases | Medium |

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests will verify that the API endpoints work correctly with PostgreSQL.

| Test Category | Description | Priority |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| API Endpoints | Test all API endpoints with PostgreSQL as the backend | High |
| Middleware Integration | Test authentication, authorization, and resource loading | High |
| Complex Operations | Test operations that involve multiple models | Medium |
| Transaction Management | Test operations that require transactions | Medium |

### 3. Database Switching Tests

Tests to verify the adapter pattern works correctly when switching between databases.

| Test Category | Description | Priority |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Runtime Switch | Test changing the database at runtime | High |
| Data Consistency | Verify data written in one database is readable from the other | High |
| Configuration Management | Test environment variable handling | Medium |

### 4. Performance Tests

Benchmark tests to compare performance between Firebase and PostgreSQL.

| Test Category | Description | Priority |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Query Performance | Compare query execution time | High |
| Load Testing | Test system under high load | Medium |
| Resource Usage | Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage | Medium |
| Connection Pooling | Test connection management | Low |

### 5. Regression Tests

Ensure existing functionality continues to work.

| Test Category | Description | Priority |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Existing Features | Test all existing features to ensure they still work | High |
| User Flows | Test end-to-end user flows | High |
| Error Scenarios | Test known error scenarios | Medium |

## Test Data

1. **Development Data**: Small, controlled test dataset
2. **Production-like Data**: Anonymized copy of production data
3. **Edge Case Data**: Specifically crafted data to test edge cases

## Test Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Setup & Unit Tests

1. Set up testing infrastructure
2. Implement unit tests for User and Pet models
3. Implement unit tests for Organization and Membership models
4. Implement unit tests for Conversation and Message models

### Week 2: Integration Tests

1. Implement integration tests for User and Pet endpoints
2. Implement integration tests for Organization and Membership endpoints
3. Implement integration tests for Conversation and Message endpoints
4. Implement authentication and authorization tests

### Week 3: Database Switching & Performance Tests

1. Implement database switching tests
2. Create performance benchmarks
3. Run load tests
4. Analyze and optimize bottlenecks

### Week 4: Regression Testing & Fixes

1. Run full regression test suite
2. Fix any issues discovered in testing
3. Document test results
4. Prepare for deployment

## Testing Tools

1. **Jest**: Main testing framework
2. **Supertest**: HTTP assertions for API testing
3. **k6**: Performance testing
4. **Postman/Newman**: API testing and collection runner
5. **Docker**: Containerized testing environments

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All unit tests pass with PostgreSQL implementation
2. All integration tests pass with PostgreSQL implementation
3. No regression in functionality compared to Firebase implementation
4. Performance meets or exceeds Firebase implementation
5. Adapter pattern correctly routes to the selected database implementation

## Monitoring and Logging

During testing, we will monitor:

1. Error rates and types
2. Response times
3. Resource utilization
4. Success/failure rates of tests

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Data inconsistency | Implement data validation tests |
| Performance degradation | Benchmark and optimize before deployment |
| Test environment issues | Use containerized environments for consistency |
| Edge cases missed | Use production-like data and specific edge case tests |

## Reporting

Test results will be documented in:

1. Automated test reports
2. Performance comparison dashboards
3. Issue tracking system for bugs found
4. Final test summary report

## Success Indicators

Phase 5 will be considered successful when:

1. 100% of unit tests pass
2. 100% of integration tests pass
3. No critical or high-priority bugs exist
4. Performance meets or exceeds targets
5. Adapter pattern correctly handles database switching
