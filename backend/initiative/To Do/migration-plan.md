# Firebase to PostgreSQL Migration Plan

## Project Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to migrate the pet-api-firebase application from Firebase Firestore to PostgreSQL using Prisma as the ORM and Railway as the PostgreSQL database provider.

> **NOTE:** This plan is supported by two additional documents:
> - [Models Analysis](./models-analysis.md) - Detailed analysis of data models and transformation strategy
> - [Authentication Strategy](./authentication-strategy.md) - Specific approach for handling authentication during migration

## Current Architecture

The application currently uses:
- **Firebase Firestore** for NoSQL document storage
- **Firebase Authentication** for user management
- **Firebase Storage** for file storage
- **Express.js** backend framework
- **Node.js** runtime

## Migration Goals

1. Replace Firebase Firestore with PostgreSQL for data storage
2. Maintain existing API contracts and functionality
3. Implement a proper data access layer using Prisma ORM
4. Improve query performance and capabilities
5. Support data relationships more effectively
6. Enable future scalability through proper database design

## Migration Strategy

We will use a phased approach to minimize disruption:

1. **Setup & Infrastructure** - Set up Prisma and PostgreSQL
2. **Schema Design** - Define Prisma schema based on current data model
3. **Data Migration** - Migrate data from Firebase to PostgreSQL
4. **Code Refactoring** - Update models and controllers
5. **Testing** - Verify functionality
6. **Deployment** - Deploy to production

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup & Infrastructure

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install prisma @prisma/client
   npm install --save-dev prisma
   ```

2. **Initialize Prisma**
   ```bash
   npx prisma init
   ```

3. **Configure Railway PostgreSQL Database**
   - Create a Railway account if needed
   - Create a new PostgreSQL database instance
   - Update the DATABASE_URL in the .env file with the Railway connection string

### Phase 2: Schema Design

> **Reference:** See [Models Analysis](./models-analysis.md) for detailed information on:
> - Current Firebase model structures
> - Recommended type mappings
> - Relationships transformation
> - Indexing strategy

1. **Create Prisma Schema** based on existing Firestore collections:
   - Users
   - Pets
   - Organizations
   - Memberships
   - Conversations
   - Messages

2. **Define Relationships** between models:
   - One-to-Many (User-to-Pets)
   - Many-to-Many (Users-to-Organizations via Memberships)
   - One-to-Many (Conversation-to-Messages)

3. **Add Indexes** for frequently queried fields

4. **Define Prisma Client Schema** in `/prisma/schema.prisma`

### Phase 3: Data Migration

> **Reference:** See [Models Analysis](./models-analysis.md) "Migration Testing Plan" section for the detailed approach to testing migration for each model.

1. **Create Migration Scripts**:
   - Script to extract data from Firebase Firestore
   - Script to transform data into proper SQL structure
   - Script to insert data into PostgreSQL using Prisma

2. **Test Migration Process** with a small subset of data

3. **Execute Full Migration**:
   - Export all collections from Firebase
   - Transform data as needed
   - Import into PostgreSQL

4. **Validate Data Integrity** after migration

### Phase 4: Code Refactoring

> **Reference:** For authentication-related changes, see [Authentication Strategy](./authentication-strategy.md) for the detailed hybrid approach and code examples.

1. **Create New Model Layer**:
   - Implement model interfaces that match existing API contracts
   - Develop new Prisma-based model implementations
   - Add data validation and error handling

2. **Update Controllers**:
   - Modify controllers to use new Prisma-based models
   - Maintain the same API endpoints and request/response formats
   - Enhance error handling as needed

3. **Implement Feature Parity**:
   - Ensure all current Firestore queries are supported
   - Add new capabilities enabled by PostgreSQL where beneficial

4. **Authentication Integration**:
   - Follow the hybrid approach detailed in the Authentication Strategy document
   - Implement dual-write system to maintain Firebase Auth while using PostgreSQL
   - Adapt middleware to work with both systems

### Phase 5: Test Suite Cleanup and Update
**Status**: In Progress
**Timeline**: 1 week

|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Data loss during migration | High | Medium | Create backups, validate data before/after migration |
| Query performance regression | Medium | Medium | Performance testing, index optimization |
| API contract changes | High | Low | Comprehensive testing of all endpoints |
| Authentication issues | High | Medium | Follow hybrid approach in Authentication Strategy document |
| Deployment downtime | Medium | Medium | Use staging environment, plan for low-traffic deployment |

## Timeline

| Phase | Estimated Duration | Dependencies |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| Setup & Infrastructure | 1-2 days | None |

5. **Clean up Firebase resources (after successful migration)**
6. **Reevaluate authentication strategy** (as outlined in the Authentication Strategy document)

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues:

1. **Identify failure point**
2. **Restore Firebase connections in codebase**
3. **Redeploy previous application version**
4. **Verify system functionality**
5. **Develop new migration plan addressing identified issues**

This plan will guide our migration from Firebase Firestore to PostgreSQL, ensuring a smooth transition while maintaining application functionality.
