| Prisma Client Mock | âœ… Complete | Using jest-mock-extended |
| Test Data Store | âœ… Complete | In-memory test data tracking |
| Test Helpers | âœ… Complete | All helpers implemented |
| Model Mocks | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | Organization, Membership, Conversation, and Message mocks complete |
| Transaction Isolation | âœ… Complete | Full transaction support implemented |
| Environment Variables | âœ… Complete | All required variables configured |
| Authentication Mocks | âœ… Complete | Firebase auth fully mocked |
| Test Data Generators | âœ… Complete | All model generators implemented |

### Current Test Coverage
| Category | Coverage | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Unit Tests | 95% | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress |
| Integration Tests | 70% | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress |
