## Migration Summary
The migration from Firebase Firestore to PostgreSQL with Prisma has been successfully completed. All phases have been implemented and verified, including:
- Database schema design and implementation
- Data migration and validation
- Code refactoring and testing
- Documentation updates
- Deployment and monitoring setup

The system now uses:
- PostgreSQL as the primary database
- Prisma as the ORM
- Firebase for authentication only
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Updated documentation

## Next Steps
