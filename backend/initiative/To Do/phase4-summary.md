# Phase 4: Code Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Phase 4 of the Firebase to PostgreSQL migration focused on refactoring the application code to support both database systems simultaneously, enabling a gradual migration approach. This phase was completed successfully with full implementation of all models, controllers, and middleware components to use the adapter pattern.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Adapter Pattern Implementation**
   - Created a central `adapter.js` module that serves as a switch between Firebase and PostgreSQL implementations
   - Enabled database selection via `USE_POSTGRES` environment variable
   - Provided consistent API contract across all model implementations

2. **Prisma Model Implementations**
   - Created PostgreSQL implementations for all models:
     - User
     - Pet
     - Organization
     - Membership
     - Conversation
     - Message
   - Maintained identical function signatures to ensure compatibility with existing code
   - Added proper error handling and logging

3. **Controller Updates**
   - Modified all controllers to use models through the adapter:
     - UserController
     - PetController
     - OrganizationController
     - MembershipController
     - ConversationController
     - MessageController
   - Ensured no breaking changes to API behavior

4. **Middleware Updates**
   - Updated ResourceLoaders middleware to use the adapter pattern
   - Modified Authentication middleware to implement the hybrid approach (Firebase Auth + PostgreSQL/Firestore)
   - Maintained security and proper error handling

## Implementation Notes

- **Data Types**: Particular attention was paid to handling arrays, JSON fields, and timestamps correctly
- **Migrations**: Ensured proper ID format compatibility between systems (UUIDs vs Firebase IDs)
- **Relations**: Properly implemented relationships that were only implicit in Firebase
- **Performance**: Leveraged Prisma's query capabilities for more efficient database operations

## Next Steps

- Implement comprehensive testing (Unit tests + Integration tests)
- Test data migration scripts with production-like data
- Deploy to staging environment for real-world testing
- Develop a monitoring dashboard to observe database performance

```
feat(database): implement code refactoring for PostgreSQL migration (Phase 4)

This commit completes Phase 4 of our Firebase to PostgreSQL migration plan, 
refactoring all models, controllers, and middleware components.

Key changes:
- Implemented adapter pattern for all database models
- Created Prisma-based implementations for all models (User, Pet, Organization, etc.)
- Updated all controllers to use the adapter pattern
- Modified authentication middleware to follow hybrid approach
- Updated resource loading middleware to work with either database

The adapter pattern allows us to toggle between Firebase and PostgreSQL using 
environment variables, enabling a gradual migration strategy.

Phase 5 (Testing) will begin next.
