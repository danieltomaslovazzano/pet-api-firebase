## 🎯 Motivation
Following the successful [E2E tests migration with 100% success rate](E2E_MIGRATION_SUCCESS_REPORT.md), this cleanup removes ~2,000+ legacy files to eliminate technical debt and simplify the codebase.

## 🔄 Changes Made

### **Files Removed**
- **~2,000+ legacy test files** from `tests/e2e/` directory
- **40+ legacy directories** (auth, conversations, memberships, messages, pets, organizations, etc.)
- **7 legacy scripts** from `scripts/` directory:
  - `run-e2e-dev.js`, `run-i18n-e2e-tests.js`, `validate-all-e2e-suites.js`
  - `final-e2e-structure-fix.js`, `fix-e2e-structure.js`, etc.
- **10 legacy npm scripts** from `package.json`

### **Configuration Updates**
